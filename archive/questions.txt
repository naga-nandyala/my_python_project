## observations

- do we run these locally (vscode) ?
- import statements inside tests (using os.sys )
- no ruff, black, isort, notebook formatting, linting tools
- yamllint settings only in github actions. can we not centralize the config for both github and azdo
- make files vs bash task runners? (bash is better and more flexible isn't it)
